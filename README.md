## AIM:
To Write a C program to find the ASCII value of a given character.
## ALGORITHM:
1. Include the standard input-output header file.
2. Define the main function.
3. Declare a variable to store the character.
4. Prompt the user to enter a character.
5. Read the character input from the user.
6. Use the %d format specifier with printf to display the ASCII value of the entered character.
## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char c;
    scanf("%c",&c);
    printf("ASCII value of %c is %d",c,c);
    return 0;
}
```
